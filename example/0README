                    EXAMPLE Directory for the TINKER Package
                    ----------------------------------------

       This directory contains several sample molecules and test files
       for use with the TINKER program package. The systems use various
       force fields. Some equilibrated molecular dynamics restart files
       for water, butane, etc. are present as *.dyn files.
