                     OTHER Directory for the TINKER Package
                     --------------------------------------

       This directory contains extra, alternative and rarely used source
       code for use with the TINKER package. Some of the code must be
       converted from Fortran common blocks to modules before compiling
       with the current TINKER. Other routines need partial rewriting to
       use current data structures.
