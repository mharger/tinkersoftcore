                     TEST Directory for the TINKER Package
                     -------------------------------------

         This directory contains some test casess illustrating use of
         several of the programs in the TINKER package.

         For example, the argon.run file contains the commands to run
         the first test case. The resulting output is found in the file
         argon.log.

         The clean.make script will remove any output files generated
         during the example runs and should be used prior to trying
         to validate TINKER executables against the provided log files.
