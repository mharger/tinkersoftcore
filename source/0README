                    Files for OpenMM-Enabled TINKER DYNAMIC
                    ---------------------------------------

          This directory contains the files needed to build a TINKER
          DYNAMIC program using the GPU-capable OpenMM libraries.
          The provided Makefile can then be
          used, after minor editing, to build a dynamic_omm.x executable.
          The Makefile assumes OpenMM is found in its default location,
          /usr/local/openmm, and that one is on a Unix based computer. 
          Make sure that the Makefile directories is correct, and that the
          correct compile options are uncommented.
          NVIDIA CUDA must be installed on the target
          machine, as well as a CUDA-capable graphics card. This code
          has been tested with later releases of OpenMM 6.2, and should
          also work with more recent versions of OpenMM.
