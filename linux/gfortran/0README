                     TINKER Notes for GNU gfortran on Linux
                     --------------------------------------

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can be
         used to build the TINKER program package on a Linux system
         using the GNU gfortran Fortran compiler.

         Please note that by default most Linux distributions limit
         stacksize and datasize for processes, as can be checked via
         the csh limit command or similar. Large TINKER executables
         will need these values increased to avoid failure at startup.
